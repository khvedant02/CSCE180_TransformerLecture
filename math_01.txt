The books in this series are selected for their motivating, interesting and stimulating sets of quality problems, with a lucid expository style in their solutions. Typically, the problems have occurred in either national or international contests at the secondary school level.
They are intended to be sufficiently detailed at an elementary level for the mathematically inclined or interested to understand but, at the same time, be interesting and sometimes challenging to the undergraduate and the more advanced mathematician. 1t is believed that these mathematics competition problems are a positive influence on the learning and enrichment of mathematics.

PREFACE


This book contains one hundred highly rated problems used in the train­ ing and testing of the USA International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) team. It is not a collection of one hundred very difficult, impenetrable questions. Instead, the book gradually builds students' algebraic skills and techniques. This work aims to broaden students' view of mathemat­ ics and better prepare them for possible participation in various mathe­ matical competitions. It provides in-depth enrichment in important areas of algebra by reorganizing and enhancing students' problem-solving tac­ tics and strategies. The book further stimulates students' interest for future study of mathematics.



INTRODUCTION

In the United States of America, the selection process leading to par­ ticipation in the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) consists of a series of national contests called the American Mathematics Con­ test 10 (AMC 10), the American Mathematics Contest 12 (AMC 12), the American Invitational Mathematics Examination(AIME), and the United States of America Mathematical Olympiad (USAMO). Partici­ pation in the AIME and the USAMO is by invitation only, based on performance in the preceding exams of the sequence. The Mathemati­ cal Olympiad Summer Program (MOSP) is a four-week, intense train­ ing of 24-30 very promising students who have risen to the top of the American Mathematics Competitions. The six students representing the United States of America in the IMO are selected on the basis of their USAMO scores and further IMO-type testing that takes place during MOSP. Throughout MOSP, full days of classes and extensive problem sets give students thorough preparation in several important areas of mathematics. These topics include combinatorial arguments and identi­ ties, generating functions, graph theory, recursive relations, telescoping sums and products, probability, number theory, polynomials, theory of equations, complex numbers in geometry, algorithmic proofs, combinato­ rial and advanced geometry, functional equations and classical inequali­ ties.
Olympiad-style exams consist of several challenging essay problems. Cor­ rect solutions often require deep analysis and careful argument. Olym­ piad questions can seem impenetrable to the novice, yet most can be solved with elementary high school mathematics techniques, cleverly ap­ plied.
Here is some advice for students who attempt the problems that follow.
• Take your time! Very few contestants can solve all the given prob­ lems.
• Try to make connections between problems. A very important theme of this work is: all important techniques and ideas featured in the book appear more than once!
• Olympiad problems don't "crack" immediately. Be patient. Try different approaches. Experiment with simple cases. In some cases, working backward from the desired result is helpful.
• Even if you can solve a problem, do read the solutions. They may contain some ideas that did not occur in your solutions, and they

viii	Introduction

may discuss strategic and tactical approaches that can be used else­ where. The formal solutions are also models of elegant presenta­ tion that you should emulate, but they often obscure the torturous process of investigation, false starts, inspiration and attention to detail that led to them. When you read the solutions, try to re­ construct the thinking that went into them. Ask yourself, "What were the key ideas?" "How can I apply these ideas further?"
• Go back to the original problem later, and see if you can solve it in a different way. Many of the problems have multiple solutions, but not all are outlined here.
• All terms in boldface are defined in the Glossary. Use the glossary and the reading list to further your mathematical education.
• Meaningful problem solving takes practice. Don't get discouraged if you have trouble at first. For additional practice, use the books on the reading list.

SOLUTlONS TO lNTRODUCTORY PROBLEMS



     3. SOLUTIONS TO INTRODUCTORY PROBLEMS

Problem 1 [Romania 1974]
Let a, b, and c be real and positive parameters. Solve the equation
 a+ bxb++ex+c +ax= Jb- ax+c -bxa+-ex.

Solution 1
It is easy to see that x = 0 is a solution. Since the right hand side is a decreasing function of x and the left hand side is an increasing function of x, there is at most one solution.
Thus x = 0 is the only solution to the equation.
Problem 2
Find the general term of the sequence defined by Xo = 3, X1 = 4 and

for all n EN.
Solution 2
We shall prove by induction that Xn = n + 3. The claim is evident for
n = 0, l.
For k	l, if Xk-1 = k + 2 and Xk = k + 3, then

as desired.
This completes the induction.


Problem 3 [AHSME 1999]
Let x1, x2, ... , Xn be a sequence of integers such that
(i) -1	Xi	2, for i = 1, 2, ... , n;
(ii) X1 + X2 +··· + Xn = 19;
(iii) x + x +··· + x; = 99.
Determine the minimum and maximum possible values of


Solution 3
Let a, b, and c denote the number of - ls, ls, and 2s in the sequence, respectively. We need not consider the zeros. Then a, b, care nonnegative integers satisfying
-a + b + 2c = 19 and a + b + 4c = 99.
It follows that a= 40-c and b = 59-3c, where O  c  19 (since b  0), so
x + x +· • • + x! = -a + b + Be = 19 + 6c.
When c = 0 (a= 40, b = 59), the lower bound (19) is achieved. When c = 19 (a= 21, b = 2), the upper bound (133) is achieved.
Problem 4 [AIME 1997]
The function/, defined by

f(x=)


ax+b, cx+d

where a, b, c, and d are nonzero real numbers, has the properties
/(19) = 19,	/(97) = 97,	and	f(f(x)) = x,


for all values of x,

d
except--.
C

Find the range of /.
Solution 4, Alternative 1
For all x, f(f(x)) = x, i.e.,

a (ax+b) +b cx+d
c (ax+ b)+ d=	x, cx+d



i.e.


i.e.


(a2 + bc)x + b(a + d) x c(a+d)x+bc+d2 -	'

c(a + d)x2 + (d2 -  a2)x - b(a + d) = 0,

which implies that c(a + d) = 0. Since c =/ 0, we must have a = -d.
The conditions /(19) = 19 and /(97) = 97 lead to the equations 192 c = 2 · 19a + b	and	972c = 2 · 97a + b.

Hence

(972 - 192)c = 2(97 - 19)a.

It follows that a = 58c, which in turn leads to b = -1843c. Therefore
f(x)=	58x - 1843= 58+	1521
X -  58	X -  58'
which never has the value 58. Thus the range of/ is JR. - {58}. Solution 4, Alternative 2
The statement implies that / is its own inverse. The inverse may be
found by solving the equation




for y. This yields


   ay+b x=--
cy+d

1-1(x)= dx-b_
-cx+a

The nonzero numbers a, b, c, and d must therefore be proportional to d,
-b, -c, and a, respectively; it follows that a = -d, and the rest is the
same as in the first solution.


Problem 5
Prove that


-(a'----b-)'-2 < -a-+ b - v,;-b < -('a	b-)'-2


for all a	b > 0.

Ba	-2

ao -	8b

Solution 5, Alternative 1
Note that
ya+ v'b)2 < l <	(ya+ v'b)2 2ya	-	-		2v'b	'


i.e.



i.e.


(a-b)2< a-2v'ab+b< (a-b)2
8a  -	2	8b	'

from which the result follows.
Solution 5, Alternative 2
Note that


a+  _b
2


v'a=b


2
( a+)b	b
-2-  - a
-a+-b+varo-.-b
2


(a - b)2


2(a + b) + 4v'ab.

Thus the desired inequality is equivalent to
4a ? a + b + 2vab ? 4b,
which is evident as a? b > 0 (which implies a?  v'ab? b).

Problem 6 [St. Petersburg 1989]
Several (at least two) nonzero numbers are written on a board. One may erase any two numbers, say a and b, and then write the numbers a +
and b -	instead.
Prove that the set of numbers on the board, after any number of the preceding operations, cannot coincide with the initial set.
Solution 6
Let S be the sum of the squares of the numbers on the board. Note that S increases in the first operation and does not decrease in any successive operation, as

with equality only if a = b = 0. This completes the proof.


Problem 7 [AIME 1986]
The polynomial
1 - x + x2 - x3 + ... + x16 - x11

may be written in the form
                 ao + a1y + a2y2 + ··· + a16y16 + a17y17, where y = x + l and ais are constants. Find a2.
Solution 7, Alternative 1
Let f(x) denote the given expression. Then
x!( x) =x-x2 +x3 -···-x18

and

Hence


(1 + x)f(x) = 1-  x18.

f(x)=	f(y-	1=)	1 - (y - 1)1s	1 - (y - 1)1s
l+(y-l)	y
Therefore a2 is equal to the coefficient of y3 in the expansion of

i.e.,

Solution 7, Alternative 2
Let f(x) denote the given expression. Then
f(x) = f(y- l) =1- (y-1) + (y-1)2 - ... - (y-1)17
= 1 + (1-  y) + (1 - y)2 + ··· + (1 - y)17.
Thus


Here we used the formula



and the fact that

G) = G) = l.


Problem 8
Let a, b, and c be distinct nonzero real numbers such that
a+ - = b + - = c + -.
b	c	a
Prove that label = 1.
Solution 8
From the given conditions it follows that
a - b = --,	b - c = --,	and c - a = --.
be	ca	ab
Multiplying the above equations gives (abc)2 = 1, from which the desired result follows.

Problem 9 [Putnam 1999]
Find polynomials f(x), g(x), and h(x), if they exist, such that for all x,
-1	if x < -l

1/(x)I - lg(x)I + h(x) = {

Solution 9, Alternative 1

3x + 2	if -1 :=:; x :=:; 0
-2X + 2  if X > 0.

Since x = - l and x = 0 are the two critical values of the absolute functions, one can suppose that
F(x)	alx + 11 + blxl +ex+ d
(c-a-b)x+d-a	ifx<-1
=	{  (a+c-b)x+a+d	if-1:=:;x:=:;0
(a+ b + c)x +a+  d	if x > 0,
which implies that a= 3/2, b = -5/2, c = -1, and d = 1/2. Hence f(x) = (3x + 3)/2, g(x) = 5x/2, and h(x) = -x + 1/2­
Solution 9, Alternative 2
Note that if r(x) and s(x) are any two functions, then
                  max(r,s ) = r + s + Ir - sl . Therefore, if F(x) is the given function, we have
F(x)	max{-3x - 3, 0} - max{5x, 0} + 3x + 2
(-3x - 3+ l3x + 31)/2 - (5x + l5xl)/2 + 3x + 2 l(3x + 3)/21- l5x/21- x + 2.


Problem 10
Find all real numbers x for which
Bx+ 27x	7
12x+ 1sx=	6°

Solution 10
By setting 2x = a and 3x = b, the equation becomes
a3 +b3	7
a2b + b2a	6'

i.e.


i.e.

i.e.

a2 -  ab+ b2	7
ab	-	6'
6a2 - 13ab + 6b2 = 0, (2a - 3b)(3a - 2b) = 0.

Therefore 2x+l = 3x+I or 2x-l = 3x-1, which implies that x = -1 and
X = l,
It is easy to check that both x = -1 and x = 1 satisfy the given equation.
Problem 11 [Romania 1990]
Find the least positive integer m such that

for all positive integers n.
Solution 11
Note that

and for n = 5, Thus m = 4.


Problem 12
Let a, b, c, d, and e be positive integers such that

abcde = a + b + c + d + e.
Find the maximum possible value of max{a, b, c, d, e}.
Solution 12, Alternative 1
Suppose that a	b	c	d	e. We need to find the maximum value of
e. Since
                     e < a + b + c + d + e	5e, then e < abcde	5e, i.e. 1 < abed	5.
Hence (a, b, c, d) = (1, 1, 1, 2), (1, 1, 1, 3), (1, 1, 1, 4), (1, 1, 2, 2), or
(1, 1, 1,5), which leads to max{e} = 5.
Solution 12, Alternative 2
As before, suppose that a	b	c	d	e. Note that

    1	1	1	1	1 l=-+-+-+-+-
bcde	cdea	deab	eabc	abed

< _!_+_!_+_!_+!+!=  3+d+e
-	de	de	de	e	d	de
Therefore, de	3 + d + e or (d - l)(e - 1)	4.
If d = l, then a = b = c = l and 4 + e = e, which is impossible. Thus d - l	1 and e - 1	4 or e	5.
It is easy to see that (1, 1, 1, 2, 5) is a solution. Therefore max{e} = 5.
Comment: The second solution can be used to determine the maxi­ mum value of {xi, x2, ... , Xn}, when xi, x2, ... , Xn are positive integers such that

Problem 14
Let x =a2 +a1+-a2 - a+1, a ER Find all possible values of x.

Since

we have


2a
X	---;:::.:;.======:	;:::.:;.=====;=,
a2 +a1+a2 - a+1

lxl < 12a/al = 2.

Squaring both sides of

x + J a2 -  a + 1 = J a2 + a + 1

yields


2xJa2 -  a+ 1 = 2a - x2•


Squaring both sides of the above equation gives


4(x2

x2(x2	4)
---=---.
4(x2 - 1)


Since a2	0, we must have

Since !xi < 2, x2 -4 < 0 which forces x2 -1 < 0. Therefore, -1 < x < l.
Conversely, for every x E (-1, 1) there exists a real number a such that
x = Ja2 +a+ l - Ja2 -  a+ l.
Solution 14, Alternative 2
Let A = (-1/2, 0,/2), B = (1/2, 0,/2), and P = (a, 0).  Then P
is a point on the x-axis and we are looking for all possible values of
d=PA-PB.
By the Triangle Inequality, IPA- PBI < IABI = l. And it is clear that all the values -1 < d < l are indeed obtainable. In fact, for such a d, a half hyperbola of all points Q such that QA - QB = d is well defined. (Points A and B are foci of the hyperbola.)
Since line AB is parallel to the x-axis, this half hyperbola intersects the
x- axis, i.e., P is well defined.

Problem 15
Find all real numbers x for which


Solution 15
It is easy to check that x = 2 is a solution. We claim that it is the only one. In fact, dividing by 13x on both sides gives
(lO)x (.!.!)x	(12)x= l	(14)x
The left hand side is a decreasing function of x and the right hand side is an increasing function of x.
Therefore their graphs can have at most one point of intersection.

Problem 16 [Korean Mathematics Competition 2001]
Let f : N x N -  N be a function such that f (1, 1) = 2,
f(m + 1, n) = f(m, n) + m and f(m, n + 1) = f(m, n) - n
for all m, n E N.
Find all pairs (p, q) such that f(p, q) = 2001.
Solution 16
We have
f (p, q)	=	f (p - 1, q) + p - 1
f(p- 2,q) + (p-  2) + (p-1)
=
=	f(l,q) + p(p; l)
=	f(l, q - 1) - (q - 1) + p(p- 1)
f (1, 1) - q(q; l)+ p(p; l) 2001.

Therefore


i.e.


p(p- l)-	q(q- l)= 1999
2	2	'

(p - q)(p + q - 1) = 2 · 1999.

Note that 1999 is a prime number and that p-q < p+q-1 for p,q EN. We have the following two cases:
l.  p - q = 1 and p + q - 1 = 3998. Hence p = 2000 and q = 1999.
2. p - q = 2 and p + q - 1 = 1999. Hence p = 1001 and q = 999.


Therefore (p, q) = (2000, 1999) or (1001, 999).
Problem 17 [China 1983]

1. la - bl::; 1/2. Then 1/(a) - /(b)I < la - bl::; ' asdesired.
2. la - bl > 1/2. By symmetry, we may assume that a > b. Then 1/(a) - /(b)I	1/(a) - /(1) + /(0) - /(b)I

Problem 18
Find all pairs of integers (x, y) such that
x3 + y3 = (x + y)2.

Solution 18
Since x3+y3 = (x + y)(x2 - xy + y2), all pairs of integers (n, -n), n E Z, are solutions.
Suppose that x + y -=/- 0. Then the equation becomes
x2 -  xy + y2 = x + y,

i.e.


x2 -  (y + l)x + y2 -  y = 0.


Treated as a quadratic equation in x, we calculate the discriminant
b. = y2 + 2y + 1 - 4y2 + 4y = -3y2 + 6y + 1.
Solving for b.	0 yields

Thus the possible values for y are 0, 1, and 2, which lead to the solutions
(1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), and (2, 2).
Therefore, the integer solutions of the equation are (x, y) = (1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), and (n, -n), for all n E Z.

2
/(1 - x) = 4-1--x-+-2
from which it follows that f(x) + /(1 - x) = 1.
Thus the desired sum is equal to 1000.

Problem 20
Prove that for n	6 the equation

Solution 20
Note that	1	1	1	1	1
a2=	(2a)2+ (2a)2+ (2a)2+ (2a)2'


from which it follows that if (x1, x2, · · ·, Xn) = (a1, a2, ···,an) is an inte­ ger solution to
-1+-1	1 -1 x2	x2+ ..·+x2--	'

then

(x1, X2, · · ·, Xn-1, Xn, Xn+l, Xn+2, Xn+3)
               = (a1, a2, · ··, an-1, 2an, 2an, 2an, 2an,) is an integer solution to

Therefore we can construct the solutions inductively if there are solutions for n = 6, 7, and 8.
Since x1 = 1 is a solution for n = l, (2, 2, 2, 2) is a solution for n = 4, and (2, 2, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4) is a solution for n = 7.
It is easy to check that (2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 6) and (2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 12, 12) are solu­ tions for n = 6 and n = 8, respectively. This completes the proof.

Problem 21 [AIME 1988]
Find all pairs of integers (a, b) such that the polynomial
ax17 + bx16 + 1

is divisible by x2 -  x - l.
Solution 21, Alternative 1
Let p and  q be the roots of x2 -  x -  l = 0.  By Vieta's theorem, p + q = l and pq = -l.  Note that p and q must also be the roots of ax17 + bx16 + 1 = 0. Thus
ap11 + bpl6 = -1 and aq11 + bql6 = -l.
Multiplying the first of these equations by q16, the second one by p16, and using the fact that pq = - l, we find
ap + b = -q16 and aq + b = -p16.	(1)

Thus




Since



  p+q p2 +q2 p4 +q4
ps + qs



1,
(p+ q)2 -  2pq = 1 + 2 = 3,
(p2 + q2)2 - 2p2q2 = 9 - 2 = 7,
(p4 + q4)2 - 2p4q4 = 49 - 2 = 47,

it follows that a= l · 3· 7 · 47 = 987.
Likewise, eliminating a in (1) gives
pl7 _ ql7
-b	=	p-q
=	pl6 + pl5q + pl4q2 + ... + ql6
(pl6 + ql6) + pq(pl4 + ql4) + p2q2(pl2 + ql2)
+ ... + p1q1(p2 + q2) + psqs

=	(pl6 + ql6_)

(pl4 + ql4) + ._..

(p2 + q2) + l.

For n	l, let k2n = p2n + q2n. Then k2 = 3 and k4 = 7, and
k2n+4	p2n+4 + q2n+4
(p2n+2+ q2n+2)(p2+ q2) _ p2q2(p2n + q2n)

for n	3. Then ka = 18, ks = 47, k10 = 123, k12 = 322, k14 = 843,
k16 = 2207.
Hence
-b = 2207 - 843 + 322 - 123 + 47 - 18 + 7 - 3 + 1 = 1597
or
(a,b) = (987,-1597).

Solution 21, Alternative 2
The other factor is of degree 15 and we write
(c1sx15 - c14x14 + ··· + c1x - co)(x2 - x - l) = ax17 + bx16 + l.
Comparing coefficients:
XO:	Co= 1,
X1 : Co - C1 = 0, C1 = 1
x2 :	-CQ - C1 + C2 = 0, C2 = 2,
and for 3	k	15,	xk :	-Ck-2 - Ck-1 + Ck = 0.


It follows that fork 15, Ck = Fk+l (the Fibonacci number).
Thus a = C1s = F15 = 987 and b = -c14 - c1s = -F11 = -1597 or
(a,b) = (987,-1597).

Comment: Combining the two methods, we obtain some interesting facts about sequences k2n and F2n-l· Since


it follows that F2n-1 and k2n satisfy the same recursive relation. It is easy to check that k2 = F1 + F3 and k4 = F3 + Fs.
Therefore k2n = F2n-l + F2n+l and


Problem 22 [AIME 1994]
Given a positive integer n, let p(n) be the product of the non-zero digits of n. (If n has only one digit, then p(n) is equal to that digit.) Let
S = p(l) + p(2) +··· + p(999).
What is the largest prime factor of S?
Solution 22
Consider each positive integer less than 1000 to be a three-digit number by prefixing Os to numbers with fewer than three digits. The sum of the products of the digits of all such positive numbers is
(0 · 0 · 0 + 0 · 0 · 1 +··· + 9 · 9 · 9) - 0 · 0 · 0
= (0 + 1 +··· + 9)3-	0.
However, p(n) is the product of non-zero digits of n. The sum of these products can be found by replacing O by 1 in the above expression, since ignoring O's is equivalent to thinking of them as l's in the products. (Note that the final O in the above expression becomes a 1 and compensates for the contribution of 000 after it is changed to 111.)
Hence
S = 463 -  1 = (46 - 1)(462 + 46 + 1) = 33 · 5 · 7· 103,
and the largest prime factor is 103.


Problem 23 [Putnam 1979]
Let Xn be a sequence of nonzero real numbers such that
Xn Xn-2Xn-1
=------
2Xn-2 - Xn-1
for n = 3,4, ....
Establish necessary and sufficient conditions on x1 and x2 for Xn to be an integer for infinitely many values of n.
Solution 23, Alternative 1

We have	1	2Xn-2 -  Xn-1 Xn-2Xn-1

= 2	1
Xn-1	Xn-2

Let Yn = 1/xn. Then Yn - Yn-1 = Yn-1 - Yn-2, i.e., Yn is an arithmetic sequence. If Xn is a nonzero integer when n is in an infinite set S, the
Yn's for n ES satisfy -1   Yn   l.
Since an arithmetic sequence is unbounded unless the common difference is 0, Yn - Yn-1 = 0 for all n, which in turn implies that X1 = X2 = m, a nonzero integer.
Clearly, this condition is also sufficient.
Solution 23, Alternative 2
An easy induction shows that

for n = 3,4, ....
In this form we see that Xn will be an integer for infinitely many values of n if and only if X1 = x2 = m for some nonzero integer m.
Problem 24
Solve the equation

Solution 24, Alternative 1
It is clear that x	-2. We consider the following cases.
1. -2	x	2. Setting x = 2cosa, 0  a	1r, the equation becomes 8cos3 a - 6cosa = J2(cosa + 1).
or
2cos3a 4= cos2  '


from which it follows that cos 3a =cos%·
Then 3a - % = 2m7l', m E Z, or 3a + % = 2n7l', n E Z. Since O ::; a::; 7!', the solution in this case is
x = 2 cos O = 2, x = 2 cos 47!,' and x = 2 cos 47!.'

2. x > 2. Then x3 -  4x = x(x2 -  4) > 0 and
x2 -  x - 2 = (x - 2)(x + 1) > 0

or


It follows that

x3 -  3x > x > Jx + 2.

Hence there are no solutions in this case.
Therefore, x = 2, x = 2cos47l'/5, and x = 2cos47l'/7.
Solution 24, Alternative 2
For x > 2, there is a real number t > 1 such that

The equation becomes

(t7 -  l)(t5 - 1) = 0,

Hence there are no solutions for x > 2.
For -2 ::; x ::; 2, please see the first solution.


Problem 25 [AIME 1992]
For any sequence of real numbers A = {a1, a2, a3, · · ·}, define 6.A to be the sequence {a2 - a1, a3 - a2, a4 - a3, ... }.
Suppose that all of the terms of the sequence 6.(6.A) are 1, and that
a19 = a92 = 0.
Find a1.
Solution 25
Suppose that the first term of the sequence 6.A is d.
Then
6.A = {d, d + l, d + 2, ... }
with the nth term given by d + (n - 1).
Hence


with the nth term given by

This shows that an is a quadratic polynomial in n with leading coefficient
1/2.
Since a19 = ag2 = 0, we must have


an=

1 (n -  l9)(n - 92),


so a1 = (1 - 19)(1 - 92)/2 = 819.
Problem 26 [Korean Mathematics Competition 2000]
Find all real numbers x satisfying the equation


Solution 26
Setting 2x = a and 3x = b, the equation becomes
1 + a2 + b2 -  a - b - ab=  0.
Multiplying both sides of the last equation by 2 and completing the squares gives
(1 - a)2 + (a - b)2 + (b - 1)2 = 0.


Therefore 1 = 2x = 3x, and x = 0 is the only solution.

which proves the lower bound. On the other hand,

Therefore
,/k < l + 2 L (,/k - v1k=I) = 2VSO - 1 < 17,

Problem 28 [AHSME 1999]
Determine the number of ordered pairs of integers (m, n) for which mn 2 0 and



Solution 28

m3 + n3 + 99mn = 333.

Note that (m + n)3 = m3 + n3 + 3mn(m + n). If m + n = 33, then 333 = (m + n)3 = m3 + n3 + 3mn(m + n) = m3 + n3 + 99mn.
Hence m + n - 33 is a factor of m3 + n3 + 99mn - 333. We have
m3 + n3 + 99mn - 333
= (m + n - 33)(m2 + n2 -mn  + 33m + 33n + 332)
= 1 (m + n - 33)[(m - n)2 + (m + 33)2 + (n + 33)2].


Hence there are 35 solutions altogether: (0, 33), (1, 32), · • ·, (33, 0), and
(-33, -33).

Problem 32
What is the coefficient of x2 when
(1 + x)(l + 2x)(l + 4x) ··· (1 + 2nx)

Solution 32
Let
fn(x) = an,o + an,1X .+ · ·· + an,nXn = (1+ x)(l + 2x) ··· (1+ 2nx).
It is easy to see that an,o = 1 and
an,l = 1 + 2 +··· + 2n = 2n+l - l.

Since


fn(x)	fn-1(x)(l + 2nx)

Problem 33
Let m and n be distinct positive integers.
Find the maximum value of lxm - xnl, where x is a real number in the interval (0, 1).
Solution 33
By symmetry, we can assume that m > n. Let y = xm-n.
Since O < x < 1, xm < xn and O < y < l. Thus

lxm - xnl = xn - xm = xn(l - xm-n) = (yn(l -yr-n)
Applying the AM-GM inequality yields
yn(l-yr-n	=	(m  n)nCm:n)y)n(l-yr-n

Problem 34
Prove that the polynomial

where a1, a2, ···,an aredistinct integers, cannot be written as the prod­ uct of two non-constant polynomials with integer coefficients, i.e., it is irreducible.
Solution 34
For the sake of contradiction, suppose that

is not irreducible. Let f(x) = p(x)q(x) such that p(x) and q(x) are two polynomials with integral coefficients having degree less than n. Then
g(x) = p(x) + q(x)
is a polynomial with integral coefficients having degree less than n.
Since
p(ai)q(ai) = f(ai) = -1
and both p(ai) and q(a,) are integers,




and


p(ai) + q(ai) = 0.

Thus g(x) has at least n roots. But degg < n, so g(x) = 0. Then
p(x) = -q(x)	and	f(x) = -p(x)2,
which implies that the leading coefficient of f(x) must be a negative integer, which is impossible, since the leading coefficient of f(x) is 1.

Problem 35
Find all ordered pairs of real numbers (x, y) for which:
(1 + x)(l + x2)(1 + x4)	= 1 + y7
and	(1 + y)(l + y2)(1 + y4)	= 1 + x7•
Solution 35
We consider the following cases.
1. xy = 0. Then it is clear that x = y = 0 and (x, y) = (0, 0) is a solution.
2. xy < 0. By the symmetry, we can assume that x > 0 > y. Then (1 +x)(l +x2)(1+ x4) > 1 and 1 + y7 < 1. There are no solutions in this case.
3. x, y > 0 and x =I y.  By the symmetry, we can assume that x >
y > 0. Then
(1 + x)(l + x2)(1+ x4) > 1 + x7 > 1 + y7,
showing that there are no solutions in this case.
4. x, y < 0 and x =I y. By the symmetry, we can assume that x < y <
0. Multiplying by 1- x and 1-y the first and the second equation, respectively, the system now reads
1 - x8  =	(1 + y7)(1 - x) = 1 - X + y7 - xy7
1 - y8  =	(1 + x7)(1 - y) = 1 - y + x7 - x7y.
Subtracting the first equation from the second yields
xs - YB = (x - y) + (x1 - y1) - xy(x6 - y6).	(1)
Since x < y < 0, x8 -y8 > 0, x-y  < 0, x7 -y7 < 0, -xy  < 0, and x6 - y6 > 0. Therefore, the left-hand side of (1) is positive while the right-hand side of (1) is negative.
Thus there are no solutions in this case.


5. x = y. Then solving
1 - xs = 1 - x + y7 -  xy7 = l - x + x7 -  xs
     leads to x = 0, l, -1, which implies that (x,y) = (0, 0) or (-1, -1).
Therefore, (x, y) = (0, 0) and (-1, -1) are the only solutions to the system.

Problem 36
Solve the equation

for real numbers x.
Solution 36
Rearranging terms by powers of 2 yields




Setting y = x2 - 1 and dividing by 2 on the both sides, (1) becomes

(1)





or
x(2Y - 1) + y(2x - 1) = 0.


(2)

Since f(x) = 2x - 1 and x always have the same sign,
x(2Y - 1) · y(2X - 1)	0.

Hence if the terms on the left-hand side of (2) are nonzero, they must have the same sign, which in turn implies that their sum is not equal to 0.
Therefore (2) is true if and only if x = 0 or y = 0, which leads to solutions
x = -l,O, and l.

Then N = b + 1/b. For the sake of contradiction, assume that N is rational. Then by using the identity

repeatedly for m = 1, 2, ... , we obtain that bm + 1/bm is rational for all
mEN.
In particular,

bn+_.b!_n =a+ +a-Ja2-1=2a
is rational, in contradiction with the hypothesis. Therefore our assumption is wrong and N is irrational.

Multiplying both sides by 2 and completing the squares yields

z)xk - Xk+1)2 = 0,
k=l
from which x1 = x2 = X3 = X4 = X5.  Therefore the solutions to the system are

But

5 - (xy + yz + zx)·

2(xy + yz + zx) = (x + y + z)2 -  (x2 + y2 + z2) = l.

Therefore S = -2/9.

Mr. Fat is going to pick three non-zero real numbers and Mr. Taf is going to arrange the thr e numbers as the coefficients of a quadratic equation

_x2 +_x+	=0.
Mr. Fat wins the game if and only if the resulting equation has two distinct rational solutions.
Who has a winning strategy?
Solution 40
Mr. Fat has the winning strategy. A set of three distinct rational nonzero numbers a, b, and c, such that a+ b +c = 0, will do the trick. Let A, B, and C be any arrangement of a, b, and c, and let f(x) = Ax2 +Bx+ C.
Then
/(1) =A+  B + C =a+  b +c = 0,
which implies that 1 is a solution.
Since the product of the two solutions is C / A, the other solution is C / A,
and it is different from l.

Since the total of b, c, d, and e is 8 - a, their average is x = (8 - a)/4.
Let

Find the real zeros of the polynomial

Solution 42
We have
(x2 + l)(x2 -  2x + 1) - ax2 = 0.
Dividing by x2 yields

( X +; ) (X -	2 +; ) - a = 0.
By setting y = x + l/x, thelast equation becomes
y2 -  2y-  a= 0.

It follows that

Write P(x) = (x - s)xcQ(x) and

The sequence given by xo = a, x1 = b, and

Prove that ab = l.
Solution 46
Multiplying by 2xn  on both sides of the given recursive relation yields


or
2(XnXn+l - 1) = Xn-lXn-	l.
Let Yn = Xn-lXn - 1 for n EN. Since Yn+l = Yn/2, {yn} is a geometric sequence. If Xn is periodic, then so is Yn, which implies that Yn = 0 for all n EN. Therefore
ab = xox1 = YI + 1 = l.

Let a, b, c, and d be real numbers such that

Prove that


Solution 47


a2 +b2 > 1 and c2 +d2 > l.

For the sake of the contradiction, suppose that one of a2 +b2 or c2 +d2 is less than or equal to l.  Since (ac + bd - 1)2   0, a2 + b2 -  1 and c2 +d2 -  1 must have the same sign. Thus both a2 +b2 and c2 +d2 are
less than l. Let
x = 1 - a2 - b2 and y = 1 - c2 -  d2.
Then O < x, y	l. Multiplying by 4 on both sides of the given inequality gives
4xy	>	(2ac + 2bd - 2)2 = (2 - 2ac - 2bd)2
(a2 + b2 + x + c2 +d2 + y -  2ac - 2bd)2
[(a - c)2 + (b - d)2 + x + y]2
2:'.	(x+y)2=x2+2xy+y2,


or O > x2 -  2xy + y2 = (x - y)2, which is impossible.
Thus our assumption is wrong and both a2 +b2 and c2 +d2 are greater than 1.

i.e.


8(3z + 1)6(4z + 1)4(6z + 1)2(12z + 1) = 768, (24z + 8)(24z + 6)(24z + 4)(24z + 2) = 768.

Setting u = 24z + 5 and w = u2 yields
(u + 3)(u + l)(u - l)(u - 3) •= 768,


i.e.

i.e.

i.e.


(u2 -  l)(u2 -  9) = 768,

Problem 53 [Romania 1990]
Find all real solutions to the equation


Solution 53
For x < 0, the function f(x) = 2x + 3x + 6x - x2 is increasing, so the equation f(x) = 0 has the unique solution x = -l.
Assume that there is a solutions 2'.: 0. Then

sos 2'.: v'3, and hence lsJ 2'.: l.
But then s 2'.: ls J yields
28 2'.: 2lsJ = (1 + l)lsJ 2'.: 1 + lsJ 2'.: s,
which in turn implies that
6s > 4s = (2s)2 2'.: 82_


So 28 + 38 + 68 > s2, a contradiction.
Therefore x = -1 is the only solution to the equation.

Problem 56
Find, with proof, all nonzero polynomials /(z) such that
/(z2) + f(z)f(z + 1) = 0.

Solution 56
Let f(z) = azm(z - ltg(z), where m and n are non-negative integers and

Zi-=/- 0 and Zi-=/- 1, for i = 1, 2, ... , k. The given condition becomes az2m(z - lt(z + lt(z2 - z1)(z2 - z2) · ·· (z2 - Zk)
= -a2zm+n(z + 1r(z - lt(z - z1)(z - z2) ··· (z - Zk)
·(z + 1 - z1)(z + 1 - z2) · ·· (z + 1 - Zk)-
Thus a = -a2, and/ is nonzero, so a = -1. Since Zi -=/- 1, 1 - z, -=/- 0. Then z2m = zm+n, that is, m = n.
Thus f is of the form
-zm(z - l)mg(z).
Dividing by z2m(z - l)n(z + l)n, the last equation becomes
g(z2) = g(z)g(z + 1).


We claim that g(z) = l. Suppose not; then clearly g must have at least one complex root r =/- 0. Now
g(r2)	=	g(r)g(r + 1) = 0,
g(r4)	0,
g(r8)	=  0,

and so on.
Since g cannot have infinitely many roots, all its roots must have absolute value 1.
Now,


so l(r - 1)21= 1.
Clearly, if

then

g((r - 1)2) = g(r - l)g(r) = 0,


lrl = l(r - 1)21 = 1,

1 + Jai 1 - Jai}
r E	2	'	2	.

But r2 is also a root of g, so the same should be true of r2:

2	{ 1 + Jai 1- 	Jai}
r	E	2	'	2	.

This is absurd. Hence, g cannot have any roots, and g(z) = l. Therefore, the f(z) are all the polynomials of the form -zm(z - 1r for mEN.

Problem 57
Let f: N-+ N be a function such that f(n+ 1) > f(n) and f(f(n)) = 3n

Evaluate /(2001).
Solution 57, Alternative 1 We prove the following lemma. Lemma	For n = 0, l, 2, ... ,
1. / (3n) = 2 · 3n; and
2. f (2. 3n) = 3n+1.


Proof	We use induction.
For n = 0, note that /(l) -::pl, otherwise 3 = /(/(1)) = /(1) = 1, which is impossible.  Since f : N -+ N, /(1) > l.  Since f(n + 1) > f(n), f is increasing.  Thus 1 < /(1) < /(/(1)) = 3 or /(1) = 2. Hence
/(2) = /(/(1)) = 3.
Suppose that for some positive integer n 2'.'. 1,


Then, and
as desired. This completes the induction.	?
There are 3n - 1 integers m such that 3n < m < 2 · 3n and there are
3n - 1 integers m' such that

Since f is an increasing function,

for 0 :'.S m :'.S 3n. Therefore
           / (2 · 3n + m) = f (f (3n + m)) = 3 (3n + m) for 0 :'.Sm :'.S 3n_ Hence
/(2001) = f (2 · 36 + 543) = 3 (36 + 543) = 3816.

Solution 57, Alternative 2
For integer n, let n(a) = a1 a2 · · · at denote the base 3 representation of
n.
Using similar inductions as in the first solution, we can prove that

Since 2001(a) = 2202010, /(2001)ca) = 12020100 or
/(2001) = 1 . 32 + 2. 34 + 2. 36 + 1 . 37 = 3816.


Problem 58 [China 1999]
Let F be the set of all polynomials f(x) with integers coefficients such that f(x) = 1 has at least one integer root.
For each integer k > l, find mk, the least integer greater than 1 for which there exists an/ E F such that f(x) = mk has exactly k distinct integer roots.
Solution 58
Suppose that fk E F satisfies the condition that fk(x) = mk has exactly k distinct integer roots, and let a be an integer such that fk(a) = l. Let 9k be the polynomial in F such that
9k(x) = fk(x + a)
for all x.
Now 9k(0) = fk(a) = 1, so the constant term of 9k is 1. Now 9k(x) = mk
has exactly k distinct integer roots r1, r2, ... , rk, so we can write

where qk(x) is an integer polynomial.
Note that r1r2 ···Tk divides the constant term of 9k(x) - mk, which equals 1 - mk,
Since mk > 1, 1 - mk cannot be 0,

Now r1, r2,: • · rk  are distinct integers, and none of them is 0, so

hence

This value of mk is attained by
9k(x)	=	(-lt;')(x-l)(x+l)(x-2)(x+2)

Problem 60 (Iran 1997]
Suppose that / : R+ -+ R+ is a decreasing function such that for all
x,y ER+,
f(x + y) + f(f(x) + f(y)) = f(f(x + f(y)) + f(y + f(x))).
Prove that f(f(x)) = x.
Solution 60
Setting y = x gives
/(2x) + /(2/(x)) = /(2/(x + f(x))).
Replacing x with f(x) yields
/(2/(x)) + /(2/(/(x))) = /(2/(/(x) + f(f(x)))).
Subtracting these two equations gives
/(2/(/(x))) - /(2x) = /(2/(/(x) + f(f(x)))) - /(2/(x + f(x))).
If f(f(x)) > x, the left hand side of this equa,tion is negative, so
J(f(x) + f(J(x)) > J(x + f(x))

and


f(x) + J(f(x)) < x + f(x),

a contradiction. A similar contradiction occurs if f(f(x)) < x.
Thus f(f(x)) = x as desired.
Comment: In the original formulation / was meant to be a continous function. The solution above shows that this condition is not necessary.


Problem 61 [Nordic Contest 1998]
Find all functions / : Q) -+ Q) such that
f(x + y) + f(x - y) = 2/(x) + 2/(y)
for all x, y E Q).
Solution 61
The only such functions are f(x) = kx2 for rational k. Any such function works, since
f(x + y) + f(x - y) = k(x + y)2 + k(x - y)2
= kx2 + 2kxy + ky2 + kx2 -  2kxy + ky2
= 2kx2 + 2ky2
= 2/(x) + 2/(y).
Now suppose f is any function satisfying
J(x + y) + f(x - y) = 2/(x) + 2/(y).
Then letting x = y = 0 gives 2/(0) = 4/ (0), so /(0) = 0.
We will prove by induction that J(nz) = n2 f(z) for any positive integer
n and any rational number z.
The claim holds for n = 0 and n = 1; let n	2 and suppose the claim holds for n - 1 and n - 2.
Then letting x = (n - l)z, y = z in the given equation we obtain
f(nz) + f((n - 2)z) = f((n - l)z + z) + f((n - l)z - z)
= 2/((n - l)z) + 2/(z)
so
f(nz) = 2/((n - l)z) + 2/(z) - J((n - 2)z)
= 2(n - 1)2 f(z) + 2/(z) - (n - 2)2 f(z)
= (2n2 -  4n + 2 + 2 - n2 + 4n - 4)/(z)
= n2f(z)
and the claim holds by induction.
Letting x = 0 in the given equation gives
f(y) + f(-y) = 2/(0) + 2/(y) = 2/(y),
so f(-y) = f(y) for all rational y; thus f(nz) = n2 f(z) for all integers

Now let k = f(l); then for any rational number x = p/q,
q2 f(x) = f(qx) = f(p) = p2 f(l) = kp2

so
f ( x) = kp2 / q2 = kx2.
Thus the functions f(x) = kx2, k E Q), are the only solutions.
Problem 62 [Korean Mathematics Competition 2000]
Let3/4< a< l.
Prove that the equation
x3(x + 1) = (x + a)(2x + a)
has four distinct real solutions and find these solutions in explicit form.
Solution 62
Look at the given equation as a quadratic equation in a:
a2 + 3xa + 2x2 -  x3 -  x4 = 0.
The discriminant of this equation is
9x2 -  8x2 + 4x3 + 4x4 = (x + 2x2)2•

Thus


a= -3x ± 2(x + 2x2)

	

The first choice a = -x +x2 yields the quadratic equation x2 - x - a = 0,
whose solutions are
(1 ± v'f+Ta}
X=	2	.
The second choice a = - 2x - x2 yields the quadratic equation
x2 +2x+a = 0,

whose solutions are

The inequalities

show that the four solutions are distinct.



Indeed



reduces to



1 - 1 +4a

2v'f=a < 3 - 1 + 4a

which is equivalent to

6 1 + 4a < 6 + 8a,

or 3a < 4a2, which is evident.

Problem 64 (AIME 1988)
Find all functions f, defined on the set of ordered pairs of positive inte­ gers, satisfying the following properties:
f(x, x) = x,  f(x, y) = f(y, x), (x + y)f(x, y) = yf(x, x + y).
Solution 64
We claim that f(x, y) = lcm(x, y), the least common multiple of x and
y. It is clear that


and

lcm(x, x) = x
lcm(x, y) = lcm(y, x).

Note that	xy



and

lcm(x, y) = gcd  (

x,y)

gcd (x, y) = gcd (x, x + y),
where gcd (u, v) denotes the greatest common <;1.ivisor of u and v. Then
(x + y)lcm(x, y)	=	(x + y) ·	xy
gcd (x, y)

= Y·

x(x + y)
gcd (x, x + y)


=	ylcm(x, x + y).
Now we prove that there is only one function satisfying the conditions of the problem.
For the sake of contradiction, assume that there is another function
g(x, y) also satisfying the given conditions.
Let S be the set of all pairs of positive integers (x, y) such that f(x, y) -1- g( x, y), and let (m, n) be such a pair with minimal sum m + n. It is clear that m -/:- n, otherwise
f(m, n) = f(m, m) = m = g(m, m) = g(m, n).
By symmetry (f(x, y) = f(y, x)), we can assume that n - m > 0. Note that
nf(m,n -m)	[m + (n - m)]f(m, n - m)
(n - m)f(m,m + (n - m))
(n - m)f(m, n)



or	n-m
f(m, n - m) = -- n


· f(m, n).

Likewise,

g(m, n - m} = -n--m
n


· g(m, n).

Since f(m, n)=/- g(m, n), f(m, n - m) =/- g(m, n - m). Thus (m,n-m) ES.
But (m, n - m) has a smaller sum m + (n - m) = n, a contradiction.
Therefore our assumption is wrong and f(x, y) = Icm(x, y) is the only solution.

Problem 65 [Romania 1990]
Consider n complex numbers zk, such that IZk I ::; 1, k = l, 2, ... , n.
Prove that there exist e1, e2, ...  , en E { -1, 1} such that, for any m ::; n,


Solution 65
Call a finite sequence of complex numbers each with absolute value not exceeding 1 a green sequence.
Call a green sequence {zk}k=I happy if it has a friend sequence {ek}k=I
of ls and - ls, satisfying the condition of the problem.
We will prove by induction on n that all green sequences are happy. For n = 2, this claim is obviously true.
Suppose this claim is true when n equals some number m. For the case of n = m + 1, think of the Zk as points in the complex plane.
For each k, let /1,k be the line through the origin and the point corre­ sponding to Zk- Among the lines £1, £2, £3, some two are within 60° of each other; suppose they are £0 and £13, with the leftover one being /1,,.r·
The  fact that /1,0 and £13 are withjn 60° of each other implies that there exists some number er; E { -1, 1} such that z' = z0 + e13z13 has absolute value at most 1.
Now the sequence z', z-y, z4, z5, ••• , Zk+I is a k-term green sequence, so, by the induction hypothesis, it must be happy; let e', e-y, e4, e5, ••• , ek+I be its friend.
Let e0 = 1.
Then the sequence {ei} } is the friend of { zi} }. Induction is now complete.

Problem 67 [Romania 1984]
Find the minimum of

Solution 67
Since loga x is a decreasing function of x when O < a < 1 and, since
(x - 1/2)2	0 implies x2	x - 1/4, we have

It follows that

Problem 68 [AIME 1984]
Determine x2 + y2 + z2 + w2 if
x2	y2	z2	w2
22 - 12 + 22 - 32 + 22 - 52 + 22 - 72 = l,
x2	y2	z2	w2
42 - 12 + 42 - 32 + 42 - 52 + 42 - 72 = l,
x2	y2	z2	w2
62 - 12 + 62 - 32 + 62 - 52 + 62 - 72 = l,
x2	y2	z2	w2
82 - 12 + 82 - 32 + 82 - 52 + 82 - 72 = 1.


Solution 68
The claim that the given system of equations is satisfied by x2, y2, z2, and w2 is equivalent to claiming that

is satisfied by t = 4, 16, 36, and 64.
Multiplying to clear fractions, we find that for all values oft for which it is defined (i.e., t-/= 1, 9, 25, and 49), (1) is equivalent to the polynomial equation


where

P(t) = 0,

P(t) = (t - l)(t - 9)(t - 25)(t - 49)
-x2(t - 9)(t - 25)(t - 49) - y2(t - l)(t - 25)(t - 49)
-z2(t - l)(t - 9)(t - 49) - w2(t - l)(t - 9)(t - 25).

Since degP(t) = 4, P(t) = 0 has exactly four zeros t = 4, 16,36, and 64, i.e.,
P(t) = (t - 4)(t - 16)(t - 36)(t - 64).
Comparing the coefficients of t3 in the two expressions of P(t) yields 1 + 9 + 25 + 49 + x2 + y2 + z2 + w2 = 4 + 16 + 36 + 64,
from which it follows that
x2 + Y2 + z2 + w2 = 36.

Problem 69 [Balkan 1997]
Find all functions f : IR _, IR such that
f(xf(x) + f(y)) = (f(x))2 + y
for all x, y E R
Solution 69
Let f(O) = a. Setting x = 0 in the given condition yields
f(f(y)) = a2 + Y,
for all y E IR.
Since the range of a2+y consists of all real numbers, f must be surjective.


Thus there exists b E JR such that f(b) = 0.
Setting x = b in the given condition yields
f(f(y)) = f(bf(b) + f(y)) = (f(b))2 + y = y,
for all y E JR. It follows that, for all x, y E JR,
(f(x))2 + Y = f(xf(x) + f(y))
= J[f(f(x))f(x) + J(y)] = f[f(x)f(f(x)) +y]
= f(f(x))2 + Y = x2 + y,

that is,


It is clear that f(x) = x is a function satisfying the given condition.


(1)

Suppose that f(x) -I x. Then there exists some nonzero real number c such that /(c) = -c. Setting x = cf(c) + f(y) in (1) yields
        [f(cf(c) + /(y))]2 = [c/(c) + /(y)]2 = [-c2 + /(y)]2, for all y E JR, and, setting x = c in the given condition yields
f(cf(c) + f(y)) = (f(c))2+ y = c2 + y,
for all y E JR.
Note that (f(y))2 = y2. It follows that
[-c2 + /(y)]2 = (c2 + y)2,
or
f(y) = -y,
for all y E JR, a function which satisfies the given condition.
Therefore the only functions to satisfy the given condition are f(x) = x
or f(x) = -x,  for x E JR.
Problem 70
The numbers 1000, 1001, • • •, 2999 have been written on a board.
Each time, one is allowed to erase two numbers, say, a and b, and replace them by the number 1/2 min(a, b).
After 1999 such operations, one obtains exactly one number c on the board.
Prove that c < 1.

By symmetry, we may assume a :::; b. Then
min(a, b) = i•

We have

from which it follows that the sum of the reciprocals of all the numbers on the board is nondecreasing (i.e., the sum is a monovariant).
At the beginning this sum is

2000 - k+ 2000 + k=	20002 -  k2>  20002=	1000·
Rearranging terms in S yields

Problem 71 [Bulgaria 1998)
Let a1, a2, ... , an be real numbers, not all zero.
Prove that the equation


has at most one nonzero real root.
Solution 71
Notice that fi(x) = 1 + a,x is concave. Hence



is concave.
Since f'(x) exists, there can be at most one point on the curve y = l(x)
with derivative 0.
Suppose there is more than one nonzero root.
Since x = 0 is also a root, we have three real roots X1 < X2 < X3. Ap­ plying the Mean-Value theorem to l(x) on intervals [x1, x2] and [x2, x3],
we can find two distinct points on the curve with derivative 0, a contra­ diction.
Therefore, our assumption is wrong and there can be at most one nonzero real root for the equation l(x) = n.
Problem 72 [Turkey 1998]
Let {an} be the sequence of real numbers defined by a1 = t and
an+l = 4an(l - an)
for n 2'.: 1.
For how many distinct values oft  do we have a1ggs = O?
Solution 72, Alternative 1
Let l(x) = 4x(l - x). Observe that
l-1(0) = {0, 1},	l-1(1) = {1/2},	l-1([0,1]) = [0, 1],
and l{Y: l(y) = x}I = 2 for all x E [0, 1).
Let An= {x E JR: r(x) = O}; then
An+l	{x E JRr: +1(x) = 0}
{ X E JR : r (f ( X)) = 0} = { X E JR : I ( X) E An}.
We claim that for all n 2'. 1, An C [0, 1], 1 E An, and
IAnl = 2n-l + l.


For n = 1, we have


A1 = {x E JR I l(x) = 0} = {0, 1},

and the claims hold.
Now suppose n 2'. 1 and An C [0, 1], 1 E An, and IAnl = 2n-l + 1. Then
XE An+l ::::} l(x) E An C [0, 1] ::::} x E [0, 1],
so An+i c [0, l].


Since /(0) = /(1) = 0, we have r+i(l) = 0 for all n	l, so 1 E An+l·
Now we have

IAn+l I	l{x: f(x) E An}I
=	L l{x: f(x) = a}I

Thus the claim holds by induction.
Finally, a199s = 0 if and only if /1997(t) = 0, so there are 21996 + 1 such values oft.
Solution 72, Alternative 2
As in the previous solution, observe that if f(x) E [0, 1] then x E [0, 1],
so if a199s = 0 we must have t E [0, 1].
Now choose 0 E [O, 1r /2] such that sin 0 = It,.
Observe that for any </J E JR,
      /(sin2¢) = 4sin2</J (1 - sin2¢) = 4sin2¢cos2</J = sin22¢; since a1 = sin20, it foliows that
a2 = sin220, a3 = sin240, ... , a1998 = sin2219970.

Therefore



a199s = 0

Solution 73

f(g(x)) = x2

XE {-1, 0, 1} ==}	x3 = X ==}	f(x) = [f(x)]2 ==}	f(x) E {0, l}.
Thus, there exist different a, b E {-1, 0, 1} such that f(a) = f(b).
But then a3 = g(f(a)) = g(f(b)) = b3, a contradiction. Therefore, the desired functions f and g do not exist.

Note that g is even and lal = lbl whenever g(a) = g(b); thus, we are allowed to define f as an even function such that
f(x) = y2, where y is such that g(±y) = x.
We claim that the functions f, g described above satisfy the condi­ tions of the problem.
It is clear from the definition off that f(g(x)) = x2. Now let y = vT[x).

Solution 75 [Moscow Olympiad 1978]
First, we introduce some basic knowledge of vector operations. Let u = [a, b] and v = [m, n] be two vectors.
Define their dot product u · v = am + bn.
It is easy to check that
(i) v·v = m2+n2 = lvl2, that is, the dot product of vector with itself is the square of the magnitude of v and v · v	0 with equality if
and only if v = [O, OJ;
(ii) U · V = V · Uj
(iii) u · (v + w) = u · v + u · w, where w is a vector;
(iv) (cu)• v = c(u • v), where c is a scalar.
When vectors u and v are placed tail-by-tail at the origin 0, let A and
B be the tips of u and v, respectively. Then AB = v - u.
Let LAOB = 0.
Applying the law of cosines to triangle AO B yields
lv-ul2	=	AB2
= OA2 +OB2 - 20A- 0Bcos0
lul2 + lvl2 - 2lullvl cos 0.


It follows that
(v - u) • (v - u) = u · u + v · v - 2lullvl cos 0,
or
U·V
cos0= lullvl'
Consequently, if O:5 0:5 90°, u • v 2". 0.
Consider vectors v1  = [a1,a2],v2 = [a3,a4],v3 = [a5,a5], and v4 =

Since there are four vectors, when placed tail-by-tail at the origin, at least two of them form a non-obtuse angle, which in turn implies the desired result.

Problem 77 [Czech-Slovak match 1997]
Find all functions / : JR. ---. JR. such that the equality
f(f(x) + y) = f(x2 - y) + 4/(x)y
holds for all pairs of real numbers (x, y).
Solution 77
Clearly, f(x) = x2 satisfies the functional equation.
Now assume that there is a nonzero value a such that f(a) f=. a2• Let y =x2 -/(x) in the functional equation to find that

1(f(x)/x2) =!(f(x)/x2) +2f(x)(x2-f(x))

or 0 = 2/(x)(x2 -  f(x)). Thus, for each x, either f(x) = 0 or f(x) = x2. In both cases, /(0) = 0.
Setting x = a, it follows from above that either f(a) = 0 or f(a) = 0 or
f(a) = a2•
The latter is false, so f(a) = 0.
Now, let x = 0 and then x = a in the functional equation to find that
f(y) = f(-y),	f(y) = f(a2 - y)


and so


f(y) = f(-y) = f(a2 + y);

that is, the function is periodic with nonzero period a2.
Let y = a2 in the original functional equation to obtain
f(f(x)) = f(f(x) +a2) = f(x2 - a2) + 4a2 f(x) = f(x2) + 4a2 f(x).
However, putting y = 0 in the functional equation gives f(f(x)) = f(x2)
for all x.


Thus, 4a2 f(x) = 0 for all x. Since a is nonzero, f(x) = 0 for all x.
Therefore, either f(x) = x2 or f(x) = 0.

Problem 79 [China 1995]
Mr. Fat and Mr. Taf play a game with a polynomial of degree at least 4:
X2n + _X2n-l + _X2n-2 +... + _X + l.
They fill in real numbers to empty spaces in turn.
If the resulting polynomial has no real root, Mr. Fat wins; otherwise, Mr. Taf wins.
If Mr. Fat goes first, who has a winning strategy?
Solution 79
Mr. Taf has a winning strategy.
We say a blank space is odd (even) if it is the coefficient of an odd (even) power of x.
First Mr. Taf will fill in arbitrary real numbers into one of the remaining even spaces, if there are any.
Since there are only n - 1 even spaces, there will be at least one odd space left after 2n - 3 plays, that is, the given polynomial becomes
p(x) = q(x) + _xs + _x2t-1,
where s and 2t - 1 are distinct positive integers and q(x) is a fixed polynomial.
We claim that there is a real number a such that
p(x) = q(x) + axs + _x2t-1
will always have a real root regardless of the coefficient of x2t-1. Then Mr. Taf can simply fill in a in front of X8 and win the game.


Now we prove our claim. Let b be the coefficient of x2t-l in p(x). Note that
1
22t-l p(2) + p( -1)
= ( 22;-1 q(2) + 2s-2t+1a + b) + [q(-1) + (-l)sa - b]

= ( 22;-1 q(2) + q(-1)) + a[2s-2t+l + (-l)s].

Since s-/:- 2t-1, 2s-2t+l + (-1)5-/:- 0.
Thus
1
 q(2) +q(-1)
a=	2s-2t+l + (-l)s
is well defined such that a is independent of b and
1
22t-l p(2) + p(-1) = 0.

It follows that either p( -1) = p(2) = 0 or p( - l) and p(2) have different signs, which implies that there is a real root of p( x) in between -1 and 2.
In either ca.se, p( x) has a real root regardless of the coefficient of x2t- 1, as claimed.
Our proof is thus complete.

Problem 80 [IMO 1997 short list]
Find all positive integers k for which the following statement is true: if
F(x) is a polynomial with integer coefficients satisfying the condition
         0 F(c) k	for	c=0,l, ... ,k+l, then F(0) = F(l) = ··· = F(k + 1).
Solution 80
The statement is true if and only if k 2'. 4.
We start by proving that it does hold for each k 2'. 4.
Consider any polynomial F(x) with integer coefficients satisfying the inequality 0	F(c)	k for each c E {0, 1, ... , k + 1}.
Note first that F(k + 1) = F(0), since F(k + 1) - F(0) is a multiple of
k + l not exceeding k in absolute value.
Hence
F(x) - F(0) = x(x - k - l)G(x),


where G(x) is a polynomial with integer coefficients. Consequently,
k	IF(c) - F(0)I = c(k + 1 - c)IG(c)I
for each c E {1, 2, ... , k}.
The equality c(k + 1- c) > k holds for each c E {2, 3, ... , k - 1}, as it is equivalent to (c - l)(k - c) > 0.
Note that the set {2, 3, ... , k - 1} is not empty if k	3, and for any c in this set, (1) implies that IG(c)I < 1.
Since G(c) is an integer, G(c) = 0. Thus
F(x) - F(0) = x(x - 2)(x - 3) ·· · (x - k + l)(x - k - l)H(x),	(2)
where H(x) is a polynomial with integer coefficients.
To complete the proof of our claim, it remains to show that H(l) =
H(k) = 0.
Note that for c = 1 and c = k, (2) implies that
              k  IF(c) - F(0)I = (k - 2)! · k · IH(c)I­ For k  4, (k - 2)! > 1.
Hence H(c) = 0.
We established that the statement in the question holds for any k  4.
But the proof also provides information for the smaller values of k as well.
More exactly, if F(x) satisfies the given condition then 0 and k + 1 are roots of F(x) and F(0) for any k  1; and if k  3 then 2 must also be a root of F(x) - F(0).
Taking this into account, it is not hard to find the following counterex­ amples:
F(x) = x(2 -  x)	for k = 1,
F(x) = x(3 - x)	for k = 2,
F(x) = x(4 - x)(x - 2)2	fork= 3.

Problem 82 [Romania 1998]
Find all functions u : JR --t  JR for which there exists a strictly monotonic function f : JR --t JR such that
f(x + y) = f(x)u(y) + f(y)
for all x, y E JR.
Solution 82
The solutions are u(x) = ax, a E JR+.
To see that these work, take f(x) = x for a= 1.
If a -:j; l, take f(x) = ax - l; then
f(x + y) = ax+y - l = (ax - l)aY + aY - l =  f(x)u(y) + f(y)
for all x, y E JR.
Now suppose u : JR --t JR, f : JR --t JR are functions for which f is strictly monotonic and f(x + y) = f(x)u(y) + f(y) for all x, y E JR.
We must show that u is of the form u(x) = ax for some a E JR+. First, 'letting y = 0, we obtain f(x) = f(x)u(0) + f(0) for all x E JR.
Thus, u(0) # 1 would imply f(x) = f(0)/(l - u(0)) for all x, which would contradict the fact that f is strictly monotonic, so we must have
u(0) = 1 and f (0) = 0.
Then f(x) # 0 for all x # 0.
Next, we have
f(x)u(y) + f(y) = f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y)u(x),
or
f(x)(u(y) - 1) = f(y)(u(x) - 1)

for all x, y E JR. That is,



for all xy # 0.



u(x) - 1
f(x)



u(y) - 1
f(y)

It follows that there exists CE JR such that
u(x) - 1= C
f(x)
for all x # 0.
Thus, u(x) = l+Cf(x) for x # O; since u(0) = 1, f(0) = 0, this equation also holds for x = 0.


If C = 0, then u(x) = 1 for all x, and we are done.
Otherwise, observe

u(x+y)	l+Cf(x+y)
1+ Cf(x)u(y) + Cf(y)
u(y) + C f(x)u(y)
=	u(x)u(y)
for all x, y E JR.
Thus u(nx) = u(x)n for all n E Z, x E JR.
Since u(x) = 1 + C f(x) for all x, u is strictly monotonic, and u(-x) =
l/u(x) for all x, so u(x) > 0 for all x as u(0) = l.
Let a= u(l) > O; then u(n) = an for all n E N, and
u(p/q) = (u(p))1/q = ap/q
for all p E Z, q E N, so u(x) = ax for all x E Q.
Since u is monotonic and the rationals are dense in JR, we have u(x) = ax
for all XE JR.
Thus all solutions are of the form u( x) = ax, a E JR+.

Problem 84 [Czech-Slovak Match 1998]
A polynomial P(x) of degree n	5 with integer coefficients and n distinct integer roots is given.
Find all integer roots of P(P(x)) given that O is a root of P(x).


Solution 84
The roots of P(x) are clearly integer roots of P(P(x)); we claim there are no other integer roots.
We prove our claim by contradiction. Suppose, on the contrary, that
P(P(k)) = 0 for some integer k such that P(k)-:/- 0.
Let
where a, T1,T2, ... , Tn are integers,

Since P(k)-:/- 0, we must have lk - Til 2': 1 for all i.
Since the Ti are all distinct, at most two of lk - T2 I, lk -T3I, lk -T4I equal 1, so
la(k - T2) ··· (k - Tn-1)I2': lallk - T2llk - T3llk - T4I 2': 2,
and IP(k)I 2': 2lk(k - Tn)I,
Also note that P(k) = Tio for some io, so IP(k)I :::; ITnl•
Now we consider the following two cases:
1. lkl 2': ITnl•	Then IP(k)I 2': 2lk(k - Tn)I 2': 2lkl > ITnl, a contradic­ tion.
2. lkl < ITnl, that is, 1:::; lkl:::; ITnl - 1.	Let a, b, c be real numbers,
a :::; b. For x E [a, b], the function
f(x) = x(c - x)
reaches its minimum value at an endpoint x = a or x = b, or at both endpoints.
Thus

It follows that

which implies that ITnl :::; 2. Since n 2': 5, this is only possible if
P(x) = (x + 2)(x + l)x(x - l)(x - 2).
But then it is impossible to have k -:/- Ti and lkl :::; ITnl, a contra­ diction.


Thus our assumption was incorrect, and the integer roots of P(P(x)) are exactly all the integer roots of P(x).

Solution 85, Alternative 1
Let Zn = 1/Yn and note that the recursion for Yn is equivalent to

Also note that z2 = V3 = x1; since the Xis and ZiS satisfy the same recursion, this means that Zn = Xn-l for all n > 1.
Thus,
Xn	Xn
XnYn=-=--.

Note that		
+ x;,_1 > Xn-1•
Thus Xn > 2Xn-1 and XnYn > 2, which is the lower bound of the desired inequality.
Since XnS are increasing for n > 1, we have



which implies that

2xn-1 > J1+ x;,_1.

Thus 3xn-l > Xn, which leads to the upper bound of the desired inequal­ ity.
Solution 85, Alternative 2
Setting Xn = cot 0n for O < 0n < 90° yields
Xn+l = cot0n + J1+cot20n = cot0n + csc0n = cot (0;).




Since 01 = 30°, we have in general 0n

Since tan 0n -:f. 0, tan2 0n is positive and XnYn > 2.

tan 2 0n < 1

so that XnYn < 3.

Problem 86 [China 1995]
For a polynomial P(x), define the difference of P(x) on the interval [a, b]
([a, b), (a, b), (a, bl) as P(b) - P(a).
Prove that it is possible to dissect the interval [0, 1] into a finite number of intervals and color them red and blue alternately such that, for every quadratic polynomial P(x), the total difference of P(x) on red intervals is equal to that of P(x) on blue intervals.
What about cubic polynomials?
Solution 86
For an interval i, let !:iiP denote the difference of polynomial P on i. For a positive real number c and a set S	R., let S + c denote the set obtained by shifting Sin the positive direction by c.
We prove a more general result.
Lemma
Let f. be a positive real number, and let k be a positive integer. It is always possible to dissect interval Ik = [0, 2kf.] into a finite number of intervals and color them red and blue alternatively such that, for every
polynomial P(x) with deg P ::; k, the total difference of P(x) on the red intervals is equal to that on the blue intervals.


Proof
We induct on k.
Fork= 1, we can just use intervals [O,t'] and (t',2£]. It is easy to see that a linear or constant polynomial has the same difference on the two intervals.
Suppose that the statement is true for k = n, where n is a positive integer; that is, there exists a set Rn of red disjoint intervals and a set Bn of blue disjoint intervals such that Rn n Bn = 0, Rn U Bn = In, and, for any polynomials P(x) with deg P ::S: n, the  total differences of P on
Rn is equal to that of Pon  Bn,
Now consider polynomial f(x) with deg/:::; n + l. Define
g(x) = f(x + 2nt') and h(x) = f(x) - g(x).
Then deg h ::S: n.  By the induction hypothesis,
L flbh = L flrh,
bEBn	rERn
or

It follows that

where


and
(If R +I and B +1 both contain the number 2ne, that number may be removed from one of them.)
It is clear that B +l and R +l form a dissection of In+I and, for any polynomial f with deg/ :::; n + 1, the total difference off on B +I is equal to that off on R +i ·
The only possible trouble left is that the colors in B +1 UR +1 might not be alternating (which can happen at the end of the In and the beginning of In+ 2nt').
But note that if intervals i1 = [a1, b1] and i2 = [b1, c1] are in the same color, then	·
6.iJ + 6.i2f = 6.i3f,



Thus, in B +l UR +l, we can simply put consecutive same color intervals into one bigger interval of the same color.
Thus, there exists a dissection

such that, for every polynomial f(x) with deg f::; n + l,

This completes the induction and the proof of the lemma.	D Setting first f = 1/4 and then f = 1/2 in the lemma, it is clear that the answer to each of the given questions is "yes."

Problem 87 (USSR 1990]
Given a cubic equation
x3 + _x2 + _x + _ = 0,
Mr. Fat and Mr. Taf are playing the following game.
In one move, Mr. Fat chooses a real number and Mr. Taf puts it in one of the empty spaces.
After three moves the game is over.
Mr. Fat wins the game if the final equation has three distinct integer roots.
Who has a winning strategy?
Solution 87
Mr. Fat has a winning strategy.
Let the polynomial be x3 + ax2 +bx+ c. Mr. Fat can pick 0 first. We consider the following cases:
(a) Mr. Taf chooses a= 0, yielding the polynomial equation
x3 +bx+ c = 0.
Mr. Fat then picks the number -(mnp)2, where m, n, and p are three positive integers such that
m2 +n2 =p2.

If Mr. Taf chooses b = -(mnp)2, then Mr. Fat will choose c = 0.
The given polynomial becomes
x(x - mnp)(x + mnp).


If Mr. Taf chooses c = -(mnp)2, then Mr. Fat will choose
b=	m2n2 _ n2p2 _ p2m2.

The given polynomial becomes
(x + m2)(x + n2)(x - p2).
(b) Mr. Taf chooses b = 0, yielding the equation
x3 + ax2 +c = 0.
Mr. Fat then picks the number
m2(m + 1)2(m2 + m + 1)3,
where m is an integer greater than 1.
If Mr. Taf chooses
a= m2(m+ 1)2(m2+m+ 1)3,
then Mr. Fat can choose
c = -m8(m + 1)8(m2 + m + 1)6.
The polynomial becomes

(x - mp)[x + (m + l)p][x + m(m + l)p],


where


p = m2(m + 1)2(m2 + m + 1)2.


If Mr. Taf chooses
c = m2(m + 1)2(m2 + m + 1)3,
then Mr. Fat can choose
a=-(m2+m+1)2.
Thepolynomial becomes

(x + mq)[x - (m + l)q][x - m(m + l)q],


where

q = m2 +m+ 1.


(c) Mr. Taf chooses c = 0.
Then the problem reduces to problem 40 of the previous chapter.
Mr. Fat needs only to pick two integers a and b such that

ab(a - l)(b - 1) =/- 0
and a+ b = -1.
The polynomial becomes either x(x - l)(x - a) or x(x - l)(x - b).

Our proof is complete.

In particular, for each of k = 1, ... , n, we obtain

Ln

f (z - (k +(i) = 0.


Summing over k, we have
L Lf(z - (1- (m)(k) = 0.
m=l k=l
Form= n theinner sum is nf(z); for other m, the inner sum again runs over a regular polygon, hence is 0.
Thus f(z) = 0 for all z E C.

Prove that d	p - 1.
Solution 89, Alternative 1
For the sake of the contradiction, assume that d :5 p - 2.
Then by Lagrange's interpolation formula the polynomial f(x) is determined by its values at 0, 1, ... , p - 2; that is,
f(x) =	'p°-2' f(k) x ··· (x - k + l)(x-	k - 1) ··· (x - p + 2)

k=O

S(f) := /(0) + /(1) + ··· + f(p - 1) = 0  (mod p).	(1)


On the other hand, (ii) implies that S(f) = J	(mod p), where j denotes the number of those k E {O, 1, ... , p- 1} for which f(k) = 1	(mod p).
But (i) implies that 1 S J S p - l.
So S(f) =/=. 0	(mod p), which contradicts (1).
Thus our original assumption was wrong, and our proof is complete.

We claim that Si= 0	(mod p) for all i = 0, 1, ... , p - 2.
We use strong induction on i to prove our claim. The statement is true for i = 0 as So = p.
Now suppose that So	S1	Si-1	0	(mod p) for some 1 S i S p - 2. Note that

Since O < i +1 < p, it follows that Si= 0	(mod p). This completes the induction and the proof of the claim. Therefore,

S(f) =	aiSi = 0	(mod p).

We use induction to prove both inequalities.
We first prove the upper bound. For k = l, it is easy to check that

Suppose that

	n

as
(2n - k + l)(2n - k - l) = (2n - k)2 -  1 < (2n - k)2.
Thus our induction step is complete. In particular, for k = n - l,

Now we prove the upper bound. Fork= l, it is easy to check that

(b) Let Cj = ai/A.
Then CjS are non-negative and I: Cj = l.

Problem 92
Prove that there exists a polynomial P(x, y) with real coefficients such that P(x, y) 2'. 0 for all real numbers x and y, which cannot be written as the sum of squares of polynomials with real coefficients.
Solution 92
We claim that
P(x, y) = (x2 + Y2 - l)x2y2 + 1
is a polynomial satisfying the given conditions.
First we prove that P(x, y) 2'. 0 for all real numbers x and y.


If x2 + y2 - 1	0, then it is clear that P(x, y) > 0; if x2 + y2 - 1 < 0, then applying the AM-GM inequality gives





or

It follows that P(x, y)	0.
We are left to prove that P(x, y) cannot be written as the sum of squares of polynomials with real coefficients.
For the sake of contradiction, assume that
n
P(x,y) = LQi(x,y)2.
i=l
Since deg P = 6, deg Qi :::; 3. Thus
Aix3 + Bix2y + Cixy2 + Diy3
+Eix2 + Fixy + Giy2 +Hix+ Iiy+ Ji.
Comparing the coefficients, in P(x,y) and E 1 Qi(x,y)2, of terms x6
and y6 gives
nnLAf
i=l= LDf
i=l=0,or Ai = Di = 0 for all i.
Then, comparing those of x4 and y4 gives
n	n
I:El=I:Gf =0,
i=l	i=l
or Ei =Ci= 0 for all i.
Next, comparing those of x2 and y2 gives





or Hi = Ii = 0 for all i.
Thus,


n	n
I:Hl = I:1; =0,

But, finally, comparing the coefficients of the term x2y2, we have
n

i=l

which is impossible for real numbers Fi.
Thus our assumption is wrong, and our proof is complete.

Problem 93 [IMO 1996 short list]
For each positive integer n, show that there exists a positive integer k
such that
k = f(x)(x + 1)2n + g(x)(x2n + 1)
for some polynomials f, g with integer coefficients, and find the smallest such k as a function of n.
Solution 93
First we show that such a k exists.
Note that x + l divides 1 - x2n. Then for some polynomial a(x) with integer coefficients, we have
(1 + x)a(x) = 1 - x2n = 2 - (1 + x2n),

or
2 = (1 + x)a(x) + (1 + x2n).
Raising both sides to the (2n)th power, we obtain

where b(x) is a polynomial with integer coefficients.
This shows that a k satisfying the condition of the problem exists. Let
k0 be the minimum such k.
Let 2n = 2r • q, where r is a positive integer and q is an odd integer. We claim that ko = 2q.
First we prove that 2q divides k0.  Let t = 2r.  Note that x2n + 1 =
(xt + l)Q(x), where

Q(x=)
The roots of xt + 1 are

xt(q-l) _ xt(q-2)+ ... _ xt+ l.

Wm = cos ((2mt-1)71')

+ ..	((2m-1)11')

m = 1,2, ... ,t;



that is,


R(x) = xt + 1 = (x -wi)(x - w2) · · · (x - Wt)-

Let f(x) and g(x) be polynomials with integer coefficients such that
ko	=	f(x)(x + 1)2n + g(x)(x2n + 1)
f(x)(x + 1)2n + g(x)Q(x)(xt + 1).


It follows that

Since r is positive, t is even. So



(1)




Since f (w1) f (w2) · · · f (Wt) is a symmetric polynomial in w1, w2, ... ,Wt with integer coefficients, it can be expressed as a polynomial with integer coefficients in the elementary symmetric functions in w1, w2, ... , Wt and therefore
is an integer.
Taking the product over m = 1, 2, ... , t, (1) gives 22n F = ki or 22r·qp =
k'{. It follows that 2q divides ko.
It now suffices to prove that ko  2q.
Note that Q(-1) = 1.
It follows that
Q(x) = (x + l)c(x) + 1,
where c(x) is a polynomial with integer coefficients. Hence
(x + 1)2n(c(x))2n = (Q(x) - 1)2n = Q(x)d(x) + 1,	(2)
for some polynomial d( x) with integer coefficients. Also observe that, for any fixed m,

Thus

and writing



we find that for some polynomial h(x), independent of m, with integer coefficients such that
(1 +Wm)th(wm) = 2.
But then (x + l)h(x) - 2 is divisible by xt + l and hence we can write
(x + l)h(x) = 2 + (xt + l)u(x),
for some polynomial u(x) with integer coefficients. Raising both sides to the power q we obtain



where v(x) is a polynomial with integer coefficients.
Using (2) and (3) we obtain
(x + l)2n(c(x))2n(xt + l)v(x)
= Q(x)d(x)(xt + l)v(x) + (xt + l)v(x)
= Q(x)d(x)(xt + l)v(x) + (x + l)2n(h(x))q- 2q,

(3)



that is,


2q = fi(x)(x + 1)2n + g1(x)(x2n + 1),

where Ji(x) and 91( x) are polynomials with integer coefficients. Hence ko	2q, as desired.
Our proof is thus complete.

Problem 95 [Romania 1996]
Let n 2". 3 be an integer, and let

Prove that one can find nine distinct numbers ai, bi, c, (i = 1, 2, 3) in X
such that the system
a1x + b1y + c1z	0
a2x + b2y + c2z	0
a3x + b3y + c3z	0
has a solution (xo,Yo, zo) in nonzero integers.
Solution 95
Label the elements of X in increasing order x1 < ··· < x3n2, and put
X1	{x1, .. -,Xn2},
X2	{xn2+1,,,,,X2n2},
X3	{x2n2+1, .. ,,X3n2}.
Define the function f: X1 x X2 x X3 -+ S x Sas  follows:
f(a,b,c) = (b-a,c-b).
Thedomain of/  contains n6 elements.
The range of /, on the other hand, is contained in the subset of S x S
of pairs whose sum is at most n3, a set of cardinality

By the Pigeonhole Principle, some three triples (ai,bi,c,) (i = 1, 2, 3) map to the same pair, in which case x·= b1 - c1, y = c1 - a1, z = a1- b1 is a solution in nonzero integers.


Note that ai cannot equal bi since X1 and X2 are disjoint, and that a1 = a2 implies that the triples (a1, b1, c1) and (a2, b2, c2) are identical, a contradiction.
Hence the nine numbers chosen are indeed distinct.

Then Sk+j > 0 if and only if k > i + 1, that is Sk + d > 0.

Problem 98 [Romania 1998]
Show that for any positive integer n, the polynomial

cannot be written as the product of two non-constant polynomials with integer coefficients.
Solution 98
Note that f(x) = g(h(x)), where h(x) = x2 + x and g(y) = y2n + l.
Since


and (2kn) is even for 1	k	2n - 1, g is irreducible, by Eisenstein's criterion.
Now let p be a non-constant factor of f, and let r be a root of p.
Then g(h(r)) = f(r) = 0, sos:= h(r) is a root of g.
Since s = r2 + r E Q(r), we have Q(s) C Q(r), so
deg p	deg(Q(r)/Q)	deg(Q(s)/Q) = deg g = 2n.
Thus every factor of f has degree at least 2n.
Therefore, if f is reducible, we can write f(x) = A(x)B(x) where A and
B have degree 2n.
Next, observe that
f(x)	=	(x2 + x)2n + 1
x2n+l + x2n + 1 = (x2 + X + 1)2n	(mod 2).
Since x2 + x + l is irreducible in Z2[x], by unique factorization we must have


Thus, if we write
A(x)		a2nX2n +···+ ao, B(x)	=	 b2nX2n +··· + bo,
then a2n, a2n-l, ao, b2n, b2n-l, bo are odd and all the other coefficients are even. Since f is monic, we may assume without loss of generality


that a2n = b2n = 1; also, aobo = f (0) = 1, but ao > 0, bo > 0 as f has no real roots, so ao = bo = l.
Therefore,

as a2n-l + b2n-l is even.
But


and (2	1) is odd by Lucas's theorem, so

a contradiction. Hence f is irreducible.
Problem 99 [Iran 1998]
Let Ji, h, /J : JR --+ JR be functions such that

is monotonic for all a1, a2, a3 E JR.
Prove that there exist c1, c2, c3 E JR, not all zero, such that

for all x E JR.
Solution 99, Alternative 1
We establish the following lemma.
Lemma: Let f, g : JR --+ JR be functions such that f is nonconstant and af + bg is monotonic for all a, b E JR. Then there exists c E JR such that g - cf is a constant function.
Proof  Lets, t be two real numbers such that /(s) =J. f(t).



Let

u - -g--('-s-)'	g-'-(-t'-)-
-	f(s) -  f(t) ·

Let h1 = g - d1f for some d1 E JR. Then h1 is monotonic. But

Since f(s) - f(t) # 0 is fixed, the monotonicity of h1 depends only on the sign of u - d1,
Since / is nonconstant, there exist X1, X2 E JR such that / (xi) # f (x2).
Let

and h = g - cf.
Then r = h(xi) = h(x2) and the monotonicity of h1 = g - dif, for each
d1, depends only on the sign of c - d1.
We claim that h = g - cf is a constant function. We prove our claim by contradiction.
Suppose, on the contrary, that there exists x3 E JR such that h(x3) # r. Since /(x1) # f(x2), at least one of /(x1) # f(xa) and f(x2) # f(xa) is true.
Without loss of generality, suppose that /(x1) # f(x3).
Let
C =-'---'--....a...--'---'--.
/(xi) - f(xa)
Then the monotonicity of h1 also depends only on the sign of c' - d1.
Since h(xa) # r = h(x1),
c #	g(x1) - g(xa) _ c'·


hence c - d1 # c' - d1.

/(xi) - f(xa-)	'

So there exists some d1 such that h1 is both strictly increasing and de­ creasing, which is impossible.
Therefore our assumption is false and h is a constant function.	?
Now we prove our main result.
If Ji, /2, fa are all constant functions, the result is trivial. Without loss of generality, suppose that Ji is nonconstant.


For a3 = 0, we apply the lemma to Ji and h, so h = cfi +d; for a2 = 0, we apply the lemma to Ji and h, so h = c'fi + d'.
Here c, c', d, d' are constant.
We have
(c'd- cd')h + d'h - dh = (c'd- cd')!i + d'(cfi + d) - d(c' Ii+	d') = 0.
If (c'd - cd', d', -d) =/- (0, 0, 0), then let

and we are done.
Otherwise, d = d' = 0 and h, h are constant multiples of Ji.
Then the problem is again trivial.
Solution 99, Alternative 2
Define the vector


for x ER

v(x) = Ui(x), h(x), h(x))

If the v ( x) span a proper subspace of JR3, we cap. find a vector (c1, c2, c3) orthogonal to that subspace, and then cif1(x) + c2h(x) + c3h(x) = 0 for all x ER
So suppose the v(x) span all of JR3.
Then ther exist X1 < x2 < x3 E JR such that v(x1), v(x2), v(x3) are linearly independent, and so the 3 x 3 matrix A with Aij = Jj(xi) has
linearly independent rows.
But then A is invertible, and its columns also span JR3. This means we can find c1, c2, c3 such that
Lci(f,(xi), fi(x2), fi(x3)) = (0, 1, 0),
i=l
and the function cif1+c2h+c3h is then not monotonic, a contradiction.


Problem 100 [USAMO 1999 proposal, Richard Stong]
Let X1, X2, ... , Xn be variables, and let Y1, Y2, ... , Y2n -1 be the sums of nonempty subsets of Xi.
Let Pk(x1, ... , xn) be the kth elementary symmetric polynomial in the Yi (the sum of every product-of k distinct yi's).
For which k and n is every coefficient of Pk (as a polynomial in x1, ... , Xn)
even?
For example, if n = 2, then Y1, Y2, y3 are x1, x2, x1 + x2 and
Pl = Y1 + Y2 + Y3 = 2x1 + 2x2,
P2 = Y1Y2 + Y2Y3 + Y3Yl =Xi+ X + 3x1x2,
p3 = Y1Y2Y3 = Xi X2 + X1X -
Solution 100
We say a polynomial Pk is even if every coefficient of Pk is even. Otherwise, we say Pk is not even.
For any fixed positive integer n, we say a nonnegative integer k is bad for n if k = 2n - 2j for some nonnegative integer j.
We will show by induction on n that Pk (x1, x2, ·· ·, xn) is not even if and only if k is bad for n.
For n = l, p1(xi) = x1 is not even and k = l is bad for n = l as
k = l = 21 - 2° = 2n - 2°.
Suppose that the claim is true for a certain n.
We now consider Pk(x1, x2, ... , Xn+i)-
Let ak(Y1, Y2, ... , Ys) be the kth elementary symmetric polynomial. We have the following useful, but easy to prove, facts:
1. O'k(Y1,Y2,···,Ys,O) =ak(Y1,Y2,···,Ys);
2. For all 1	r	s,
O'k(Yl,···,Ys) =  L [o-i(Y1,···,Yr)O'j(Yr+l,""",Ys)];
i+j=k

L	(x+Yi1)(x+yi2)···(x+yik)
i1<i2<•••<ik
k
I:
i1<i2<..•<ik r=O	s1<s2<" <sr
{s1,..·,sr} {i1, · ,ik}





Hence

Pk(X1,X2, ··· ,Xn+1)
= L [pi(x1, ·· ·, Xn) ·
i+j=k
O'j(Xn+l, X1 + Xn+l, · ··, X1 + X2 +··· + Xn+1)]
L	2	;)Pi(x1,···, Xn)Pr(x1, ·· ·, Xn)X +; •
i+j=k r=O	J

By the induction hypothesis, every term of Pr(x1, x2 · ··, xn) is even un­ less r = 2n - 2t, for some O	t	n.
For such r, note that


is even unless j - r = 0 or j - r = 2t.
Therefore, taking coefficients modulo 2,

Pk(X1,X2, ··· ,Xn+l)
= L Pi(X1, X2, · · ·, Xn)Pj(X1, X2,· · · Xn) i+j=k


By the induction hypothesis, the terms in the first sum are even unless
k - 2n = 2n - 2" for some O	u	n, that is k = 2n+l - 2".
In the second sum, every term appears twice except the term

fork even.
By the induction hypothesis, this term is even unless k /2 = 2n - 2", for some O	v	n, that is k = 2n+l - 2"+1.
It follows that Pk(x1, x2,· ·· Xn+1) is even unless k = 2n+l - 2w for some
0	w	n + 1, i.e., k is bad for n + 1:


Furthermore, note that the odd coefficients in


occur for different powers of Xn+l·
Therefore, the condition that k is bad for n + 1 is also sufficient for

to be odd.
Our induction is complete.

Problem 101 [Russia 2000]
Prove that there exist 10 distinct real numbers a1, a2,... , a10 such that the equation

has exactly 5 different real roots.
Solution 101
We show that {a1,a2,.,.,a10} = {7,6, ... ,-2} is a group of numbers satisfying the conditions given in the problem.
The given equality becomes
(x - 2)(x - l)x(x + l)(x + 2)g(x2) = 0,
where
g(u)	2[((7 + 6 + .. • + 3)u2 +
(7 · 6 • 5 + 7 · 6 · 4 +··· + 5 · 4 · 3)u + 7 · 6 ··· 3].
If g(u) = has no real solutions, then g(x2) = 0 has no real solutions.
If u1 and u2 are real solutions of g( u) = 0, then u1+u2 < 0 and u1u2 > 0, that is, both u1 and u2 are negative.
It follows again that g(x2) = 0 has no real solutions. Our proof is complete.

Let a and f3 be two complex numbers. The inequality
                       !a + /31	!al + 1/31 is called the triangle inequality.
Let a = 01 + a2i and {3 = /31 + /32i, where 01, 02, /31, /32 are real numbers. Then a+ f3 = (01 + /31) + (02 + /32)i.
Vectors u = [01, 02], v = [/31, /32], and w = [01 + /31, 02 + /32] form a triangle with sides lengths !al, 1/31, and !a+ /31-
